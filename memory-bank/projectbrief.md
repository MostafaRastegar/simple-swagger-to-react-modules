# Project Brief: Swagger to Modules

## Project Overview
This project aims to convert Swagger (OpenAPI) specifications into modular, structured code. It will provide a way to generate modules from a given Swagger file, facilitating the development of API clients or server stubs.

## Core Requirements
1. **Input**: Accept Swagger (OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.x) JSON specifications.
2. **Processing**: Parse the Swagger file and extract relevant information (paths, operations, parameters, schemas, etc.).
3. **Generation**: Generate code modules (e.g., TypeScript/JavaScript) based on the parsed Swagger data.
4. **Modularity**: Ensure generated code is well-structured and modular.
5. **Customization**: Allow basic customization options for code generation (e.g., output language, naming conventions).

## Goals
- Automate the boilerplate code generation for API interaction.
- Provide a flexible and extensible code generation tool.
- Improve developer productivity by reducing manual effort in creating API client/server code.
