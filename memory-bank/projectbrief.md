# Project Brief

## Project Name
**simple-swagger-to-react-modules**

## Core Purpose
A CLI tool that generates React modules from Swagger/OpenAPI specifications, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for clean architecture and separation of concerns.

## Key Objectives
1. **Automated Code Generation**: Transform Swagger/OpenAPI specifications into TypeScript React modules
2. **DDD Architecture**: Generate code following Domain, Application, and Presentation layer separation
3. **Developer Productivity**: Provide a CLI tool that streamlines API integration workflow
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Generate standardized code following established patterns

## Target Users
- Frontend developers working with REST APIs
- Teams adopting DDD architecture patterns
- Projects needing rapid API integration development

## Core Requirements
- Parse Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specifications
- Generate TypeScript code
- Support DDD layering: domains, services, presentation
- CLI interface for easy integration into development workflows
- Output structured React modules ready for use

## Current Scope
- CLI tool with generators for models, services, endpoints, and presentation layers
- Support for Swagger Petstore example API
- TypeScript/React output targeting modern development practices

## Success Metrics
- Ability to parse valid Swagger specifications
- Generate clean, maintainable TypeScript code
- Provide working example modules demonstrating DDD patterns
- Easy CLI usage for developers

## Project Status
**Implementation Complete**: The CLI tool is fully implemented with all core generators functional, working examples available, and recent fixes applied. The tool is ready for use and testing.
